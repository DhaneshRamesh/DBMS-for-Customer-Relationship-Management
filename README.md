# DBMS-for-Customer-Relationship-Management
CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, and it refers to the process of managing and analyzing customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle, with the goal of improving business relationships with customers, customer retention and driving sales growth.
The CRM system can provide various features such as data analytics and reporting, task management, and automation of various customer-related processes. This system can be helpful for businesses to better understand their customers, analyze customer behavior, and tailor their marketing efforts to target specific customers based on their preferences.



# Focus
* Our project Customer Relationship Management system is designed to record and resolve user's problems based on their orders and to request the services of a company. The aim of the project is to provide a one stop solution to raise a ticket, request a quote and to resolve problems in an efficient and an organized way. 

* It includes maintenance of User details, ticket details, quote details along with User login check details. The system allows the user to check the status of the ticket and quote that are raised by the user. This system allows the admin to resolve the problem and to delete a user entirely from the system. The system asks the user to enter his details such as name, password(pwd), email and contact number to register.
